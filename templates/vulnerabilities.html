        <h2>ARP Spoofing / Man-in-the-Middle</h2>
        <p>
            Attackers send forged ARP responses to redirect traffic through their system.
            Packet scanners can detect abnormal ARP replies and duplicate MAC-IP mappings.

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Port Scanning</h2>
        <p>
            Reconnaissance technique where attackers send packets to multiple ports.
            Detected by identifying sequential connection attempts to many ports from one source IP.

        <h2>DNS Tunneling</h2>
        <p>
            Malicious actors encode data inside DNS queries to bypass firewalls.
            Unusual domain lengths and high-frequency DNS requests can indicate tunneling.
        </p>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Suspicious Protocol Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Unexpected protocols (e.g., ICMP floods or unusual TCP flags) may indicate malware
            command-and-control or denial-of-service activity.
